# This is a test of two handsoldered SK6812-Mini-E RGB Leds which are compatible with the
# neopixel protocol. I got it from amazon.de (https://amzn.eu/d/14DKVMW) 

# The soldering is tricky there is a youtube video explaining the handsoldering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL
# I am still strugeling, but for me it helped to use stranded wire and adding flux to the pads wire

# Connection
# SK6812 Mini-E VDD <-> PICO VBUS (=5V)
# SK6812 Mini-E DIN <-> PICO GP0
# SK6812 Mini-E GND <-> PICO GND
# 
# NOTE: Connecting it like that runs the LED without the specs and I am surprised it works.
# Because based on the specs, the DIN HIGH must be at least 0.7*VDD which is 3.5V with 5 V VDD. The
# Pico IO HIGH provides 3.3V which is below 3.5V so it shouldn't work. 

# The workaround I found from leoleosuper on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/fightsticks/comments/182vumd/comment/ku6b12a/)
# suggests that for the first (only for the first) LED you add a diode between the 5V from the PICO
# and the VDD. The diode has a voltage drop that is enough to get the 3.3V of the logic within the
# Specs and the VDD is also still high enough to be in the VDD Specs (>3.5V). The DOUT of the
# first LED is scaled upwards so that all further LEDS can be run with 5V without a diode.
# One potential disadvantage is, that the first LED might be not as bright as the others.
