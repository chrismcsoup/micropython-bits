# micropython-bits

This repo is a collection of bits and pieces of micropython code I wrote or copied from others to get some hardware modules running mostly on the raspberry pi pico (w). 

I publish it because, even if I doubt it, maybe someone might find it useful.

# License

All my stuff in this repo is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE file). But note that some files that I copied from other repos might have a different license. 

Because this repo is such a mess, my files are currently all having  "test" in its name, and in the header comments mention if there are files or projects I copied to get this test up and running.

I will clean the files up in the future to make this easier.

So long, have fun experimenting!
